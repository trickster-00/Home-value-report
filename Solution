### Test Q: What are all the factors that could influence residential home prices across the United States over the next decade? And how?

Home value is determined by what willing buyers in the market are willing to pay for your home, but each buyer is unique.
Some major factors that effect are:

1. <b>Economic change</b>
  - Interest Rates : Mortgage monthly payment values are influenced by interest rates. A period of high interest rates would raise mortgage costs and reduce demand for home purchases. 
                     In comparison to renting, high interest rates make renting more appealing. Homeowners with high adjustable mortgage rates are more affected.
                     
  - Unemplyment : One of the most important economic factors influencing the housing market is economic growth. As unemployment rises, fewer and fewer people will be able to purchase a home. 
                  However, fear of job loss can deter people from entering the real estate market.
                  
  - Mortgage Availability : During the boom years of 1996-2006, most banks were eager to lend mortgages. It allowed people to borrow large sums of money. 
                            Banks also provide minimal deposits that cover 100% of mortgages. Because of the flexibility of hypothecating, housing demand increased as more people were able to buy now. 
                            Nonetheless, since the 2007 credit crunch, banks and construction firms have had difficulty raising funds to finance the financial markets. As a result, 
                            their borrowing conditions for a larger down payment on a house have improved. Loan supply has been limited, and demand has fallen.
                            
2. <b>Age and condition</b>
  - Upgrades : The dated kitchen and bathrooms immediately identify an older home. Homebuyers look to these areas first to determine if a property is right for them, or to estimate how much money they'll need to spend to bring it up to date. 
               This is reflected in the selling price of your home on the open market. Consider remodelling with the "bells and whistles" that modern conveniences bring to bring your home into the twenty-first century.
               Make these improvements for your own benefit as well as the future value of your home.
               
  - Systems : An older home should not be discounted because of its "guts." It is critical to upgrade the electrical system to meet the needs of a modern family.
              Replacing the air conditioner with a newer model that does not use Freon saves not only energy but also money. 
              Plumbing must also be addressed, especially if kitchen and bath upgrades are being considered. All of these measures prevent the depreciation of an older property. 
              Consider replacing your roof if it is more than 15 years old. On homes with older roofs, a buyer will request a roofing credit. The deal may also fall through because the buyer may be unable to obtain hazard insurance due to the age or condition of the roof.
              
3. <b>Location</b>
  - Transport : When buying a home, you should think about how convenient the transportation and infrastructure are. While this refers to the distance between the residence and the nearest public transportation point, 
                it also refers to how easily one can access the nearest main road, avoid longer routes while commuting, and avoid bad road conditions.
                
  - Amenities : a. Luxury : Everyone's social life revolves around entertainment, and the proximity of fine dining caf√©s, movie theatres, or clubhouses to a residential property can easily increase the property value.
                            Although these amenities are not considered basic or necessary, they are what make a location "a prime location.".
                
                b. Essentials : While it is understandable that one's workplace cannot always be close by, the same does not apply to a school. Homebuyers with young children prefer properties in the  same or nearby neighbourhood with a few good schools.
                                Similarly, expecting someone to commute for an hour or two for daily groceries is unrealistic.
                  
4. <b>Home Size and Usable Space</b> 
  - Room Count : The number of bedrooms and bathrooms is more important than the size of the house. A smaller house with an extra bedroom is likely to be worth more than a larger house without the bedroom.
                 In your market, there can be a significant difference between two, three, and four bedroom homes. Many times, a bedroom is added that is so small that it should not even be called a bedroom.
                 The dimensions of each room are noted on the listing sheet.
                 
5. <b>Historical sale prices</b> 
  - The historical sale price of the property is one of the first things real estate agents, appraisers, and prospective homebuyers look at. If the property has sold three times in the last three years for $150,000, $155,000, and $153,000, 
    it seems reasonable to begin with a valuation of around $150,000 and adjust based on any new additions or changes to the property. Historical prices are typically influenced by the other factors on this list.
